This project is developed on MERN stack using node and express js for backend , mongodb for the database and react for frontend.

We can use npm start to start the backend, npm run dev for frontend. I have also used concurrently which helps to run both the frontend and backend. For it we can use npm run dev command on
the root folder. 
Backend is running on port 3002 and the routes are
Add blog : localhost:3002/blog/add
Get Blogs  : localhost:3002/blog/get
Delete Blogs : localhost:3002/blog/delete
Update Blogs : localhost:3002/blog/update

In frontend the update modal opens at the bottom below the all blogs part and everything is working finee
